# Numerical TimeEvolution & Pyramidal Inversion
(Originally made for an assignment in Quantum Physics class)
This python class allows you to run numerical Schr√∂dinger time evolution on wave functions in varying time-independent potentials using [Crank-Nicolson's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crank%E2%80%93Nicolson_method). There are options to animate the evolution of the wavefunction either as a pdf or as a double plot with imaginary and real part separated as different colors. You may also plot two separate pdf:s at the same time. I have also added the option to save the animation as a .gif or .mp4 file (Note that for mp4-files, FFmpeg is required).

Various dimensionless wavefunctions and potentials are already built into the class, including that of an ammonia-molecule so that its pyramidal inversion can be simulated. I have also added a separate animation option specifically for pyramidal inversion simulations.
